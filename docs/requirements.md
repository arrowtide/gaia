## Shopify API

Starting with version `2024-10` and beyond, Gaia's releases will adhere to **Semantic Versioning**:

1. **Major Releases**: Gaia's major version will increment in the following cases:
    - When Shopify introduces breaking API changes that require updates for compatibility.
    - When Gaia includes significant feature additions or major refactors that introduce breaking changes.

2. **User-defined Shopify API Version**:
    - The Shopify API version is configurable by the user during app creation.
    - Gaia ensures compatibility with supported API versions and reflects this in its release cycle.

This plugin requires a Shopify account to function:

- For testing: You can create a free [Shopify Partner account](https://partners.shopify.com).
