# Requirements

[TOC]

## Statamic

- **Statamic**: Version `5.18` or higher
- **PHP**: Version `8.1` or higher
- **Shopify API**: Version `2024-10` or higher

## Shopify API

Starting with version `2024-10` and beyond, Gaia's releases will adhere to **Semantic Versioning**:

1. **Major Releases**: Gaia's major version will increment in the following cases:
    - When Shopify introduces breaking API changes that require updates for compatibility.
    - When Gaia includes significant feature additions or major refactors that introduce breaking changes.

2. **User-defined Shopify API Version**:
    - The Shopify API version is configurable by the user during app creation.
    - Gaia ensures compatibility with supported API versions and reflects this in its release cycle.

This approach balances user flexibility with clear versioning for compatibility and feature enhancements.

This plugin requires a Shopify account to function:

- For testing: You can create a free [Shopify Partner account](https://partners.shopify.com).
- For production: A [Shopify Lite account](https://www.shopify.com/lite) will be required when your site goes live.

Please note that third-party apps from the Shopify store may impact Gaia's behavior.

## Rad Pack Shopify
Gaia is tightly intergrated with [Shopify by The Rad Pack](https://statamic.com/addons/rad-pack/shopify). That plugin should be installed first before installing Gaia.

Please follow [these steps](https://statamic-shopify-docs.vercel.app/setup).

Gaia requires `^4.3.2` of the Shopify plugin.
