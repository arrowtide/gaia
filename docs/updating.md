# Updating

## Composer

You can update Gaia using composer:
```zsh
composer update arrowtide/gaia --with-dependencies
```

## Updating the starter kit
Gaia at it's core is a Starter Kit. Since the starter files are yours and in your root directory, updates to these files can't be automated. We try our best to decouple the starter files from the plugin code so you won't have to update manually often.

You can checkout the changelog to find out what features and files have been updated. It'll be easy to see what files have changed in the Pull Requests (they'll be linked in the changelog). You can use a diffing tool to make this even easier.
