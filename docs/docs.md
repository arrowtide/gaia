Gaia is a multifunctional starterkit for building Headless Shopify sites. It ties together with the Shopify (The Rad Pack) addon to provide a set of tools for building awesome Shopify sites.

With comprehensive documentation and an open repository, it ensures you always have the latest tools, best practices, and bug fixes at your fingertips. Designed to be repeatable, scalable, and flexible, Gaia provides a consistent foundation for building high-quality sites. For agencies and freelancers, this means spending less time reinventing workflows and more time delivering polished, reliable results.


## Technology
We've used the technologies people are familiar with when building Statamic sites. We wanted to make it as beginner friendly as possible, whilst maintaining a robust and flexible system that advanced users can take advantage of. Gaia is built on the SALT stack (Statamic, AlpineJS, Laravel, TailwindCSS).
